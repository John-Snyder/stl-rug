In this talk I will walk through a basic binary classification project using R's caret package. [caret](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=caret), which stands for classification and regression training, is intended to streamline the common steps in model training and validation. It provides a uniform interface through which a variety of algorithms can be applied (like random forest or diverse artificial neural nets) and by providing this uniform interface it presents a natural opportunity to focus on shared high-level ideas of model training and tuning. I will explain some of the specific tools in caret, emphasize their relation to important cross-validation concepts, and show how caret allows the practitioner to train models in what you might call a model-agnostic way.
