What happens when a Sales & Marketing guy realized that there’s a better way to harvest and process prospect and sales data but there’s nobody with time at his IT consulting firm to help him?

He takes Essential Fundamentals of R and Applied Data Science with R at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and cobbles together working solutions that: 
* Online prospect database harvesting, cleaning, processing and automation, and 
* DIY Data Science for Pipeline, Sales and Profitability analysis. 

My talk will be on how I went, in 2 months, from knowing nothing to having two working R solutions that provide me infinite value and tremendous time savings.
