More often rather than not, organizations tend to use bottom-line metrics in order to define the current status of an operation. Think of "end of year attrition rate", "total errors per year", "total injuries per period", etc.

Is this the best approach? Have you thought about a time variable being factored into this equation? If so, survival analysis might be the next logical step.

In this session, we will discuss how to analyze, visualize and present findings using survival analysis. Some of the packages we will use are: [survminer](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=survminer), [survival](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=survival), [binr](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=binr), and [gbm](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=gbm).
