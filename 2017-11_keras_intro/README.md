Neural networks and deep learning are increasingly popular, and increasingly accessible with libraries like [Keras](https://keras.io/). Keras is a high-level neural networks API, capable of running on multiple neural network back-ends (e.g. [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)). Keras is written in Python, but usable from R via the [keras R package](https://github.com/rstudio/keras).

I will walk the group through how to install and configure Keras with R. Then we will look at some simple use cases that demonstrate how to use the basic features of Keras.
