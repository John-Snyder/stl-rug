This meeting will focus on how to develop an R package from scratch using [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools), [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). A package bundles together code, data, documentation, and tests. Packages are fundamental units of shareable code and are one of R's the great strengths. However packages are useful even you never share you code, because they promote practices that make it practical to use packages as a way to make an analysis a self-contained unit. The “devtools” and “roxygen2” packages facilitate the process by automating common development tasks and protecting you from potential problem. Both tools work seamlessly with RStudio seamlessly. Join us for this hands-on tutorial covering the basics of building R packages.
