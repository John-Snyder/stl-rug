[Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) and R together offer an enjoyable way for business users to quickly consume complex analytical insights. Outside the business domain, the same tools are available for visualizing public data of cultural interest. The open source [Correlates of War (COW) project](http://www.correlatesofwar.org/) has been gathering datasets that track all militarized conflicts since the early 1800s along with other time-indexed factors like religion, ideology, and economic power. Do these time series correlate in meaningful ways? What would it look like to visually tell the story of 200 years of global conflict? Using a tabular model linked to these online csv files, I provide examples of where out-of-the-box visualizations in Power BI suffice and where custom modeling and visualization in R get us further.
