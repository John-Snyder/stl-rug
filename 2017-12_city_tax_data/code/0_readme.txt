I encourage you to reference the pdf presentation for how to setup DSTK to run locally

I encourage the following order for review:

test_text_tools.r		examples of some DSTK functions from R

house_code_func.r		review as referenced; just functions

test_address_tools.r		RSDTK specific
test_city_data.r		starts getting at city data loads, no joins


house_cost_estimate_report2-sales.rmd		builds out a report using not provided data table set
house_cost_estimate_report2-sales.html		the built example report
