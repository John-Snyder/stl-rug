Bill will discuss using the [Data Science Toolkit](https://github.com/petewarden/dstk) (DSTK) with city tax data. DSTK is a group of analytical methods prepackaged as a server environment that you can query with your data like an API. It aims to be more accessible to data scientists, which means the methods are useful for quick and dirty analysis. For example, fast text and sentiment mining. Bill will discuss DSTK in the context of adding metadata to existing St Louis City property tax data for more interesting mash ups.

See the [code](code/) directory for R scripts and a couple reports.
