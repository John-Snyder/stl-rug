This month's meetup will feature two shorter topics by Nick. Please feel free to start discussing and asking questions about the topics in the comments or on the slack channel (email me if you need an invitation).

## 1. Using Google APIs from R 
This presentation will use two Google APIs from R to determine the driving distance between 172 pairs of starting addresses and destination locations. The Google Places API can be used to find the destination address from their location. Then the Google Maps Distance Matrix API can determine the driving distance between the starting and destination addresses.

## 2. Handling Large Data (not BigData) Sets 
This presentation will analyze Physician Open Payment Sunshine Act Data, which contains several million observations for payments made to physicians by drug and medical device companies. We will cover downloading, unzipping, importing, summarizing, and graphing these data. Packages from the tidyverse will be used.
