Homomorphic encryption is a way of concealing data that allows you to do computations on encrypted data and get the "right" answer. If you have an algorithm that requires plaintext input to answer a particular question, there is a special algorithm you can run on the encrypted ciphertext to produce a ciphertext "answer" that will be the correct plaintext answer if and when you decrypt it. In this presentation, I will talk a bit about this technology and its recent progress before outlining some of the libraries that have appeared for applying it in R. We'll then look at some basic analyses with a twist: they will be done entirely on data encrypted with these new tools, and we'll work exclusively with encrypted data before decrypting our answers at the end.
