The famous application of association rule learning is discovering the interesting 'beer and diapers' relationships in large point-of-sale databases, and it is generally an interesting tool for datasets that are very large, thick or resistant to being structured in a rigidly tabular format.

I will provide a gentle, very R-specific introduction to association rule learning and the [arules](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=arules) package. Although I will give some general background on association rule learning in general, the focus of the talk will be on practical issues specific to R including elaboration on wrangling data, typing issues, managing the demands of large datasets, and visualizations available for interpretation of results.
