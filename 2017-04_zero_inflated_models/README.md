Some animal behavior studies involve count data, such as the number of times that an animal performed a certain activity during a fixed time span. Others involve continuous data, such as the fraction of a provided meal that was consumed.  Often, the animals do not participate in the activity under surveillance, and the data include more zeroes than would be predicted using a model from a standard probability distribution.

The zeroes represent interesting aspects of behavior that should not be ignored. Using examples from entomology and pet food development, this presentation will demonstrate some methods for graphing, summarizing, and analyzing [zero-inflated data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-inflated_model) with R packages [ggplot2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2), [dplyr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr), [pscl](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pscl), and [zoib](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=zoib).
