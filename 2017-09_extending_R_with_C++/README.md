Computing has become central to both research and applied statistics. To this end, the R language and environment has established itself as the lingua franca of Statistics. But there can always good reasons for « Extending R » (to quote Chambers, 2016). In this talk we motivate, introduce and discuss the [Rcpp](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp) package which has become the most-widely used facility for extending R. We illustrate use cases from very simple incremental replacements of small code R fragments by relying on more performant C++, to extending and connecting R to other computational libraries exposing C/C++ interfaces.
