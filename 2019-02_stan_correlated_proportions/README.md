[Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) is a platform that performs Bayesian MCMC analyses using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, a fast, efficient posterior sampling algorithm. This talk will illustrate the use of Stan within an R script to analyze a small data set involving correlated proportions from a pet food preference experiment.

The talk will include using the [zCompositions package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=zCompositions) to prepare data with small proportions having left-censoring. It will also show two ways of performing symbolic algebraic manipulations for an intermediate step.
