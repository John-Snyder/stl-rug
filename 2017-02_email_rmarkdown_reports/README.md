This meetup will include a brief overview of [R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and then discuss some specific use cases for e-mail based reporting, such as: daily status reports, event-based alerts, or scheduled data analyses.  We will cover tips for implementing e-mail based R Markdown reporting, including automating report delivery, formatting to display properly in e-mail clients, and attachments for offline viewing.
