## neoWordNet: Capturing the English language in Neo4j with R
By: Brian Loyal

[WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) is a lexical database of the English language. First developed by [George Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Armitage_Miller) in 1985, it provides a resource for programmatically exploring the relationships between groups of words. This presentation will focus on  implementation of WordNet in [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/product/), a leading graph database technology. Join us to find out how working with WordNet and Neo4j changed the presenters approach to programming in R. 



## networkly: network visualization in R using Plotly
By: Dmitry Grapov

In addition to their more common uses, networks can be used as powerful multivariate data visualizations and exploration tools. Networks not only provide mathematical representations of data but are also one of the few data visualization methods capable of easily displaying multivariate variable relationships. This presentation will discuss interactive network visualization in R using [Plotly](https://plot.ly/).

Here are [my slides](http://dgrapov.github.io/Rusers_networkly/#1) and the [networkly R package](https://github.com/dgrapov/networkly).
