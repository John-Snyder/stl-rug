Reproducibility is an essential component of scientific research and advancement. As we generate more and more data, we also need to speed up our data analysis and report generation. [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) combines the power of R programming language and a simple plain text markdown format, enabling data scientists to reproducibly complete the analysis and produce report in html, pdf format.  This presentation will give a brief introduction of R Markdown and show an example use in bioinformatic data analysis.

Nengbing Tao, Senior Computational Biologist at Monsanto, will present.
