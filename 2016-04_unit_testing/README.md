Unit tests or automated piece of code that check an assumption about the behavior of a unit of work in the system are integral to the development and maintenance of robust code and software. From R packages to Shiny applications, unit tests can ensure that your code is working as you expect and help you make modifications and add new features with a peace of mind that you are not breaking anything in the process.
