Visualization is very important in analyzing data to understand the intricacies that are not visible by just checking numbers and descriptive statistics. Especially visualizing spatial data can reveal the effect of location on the outcome and provide great insight. R packages such as [ggplot](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2) and [ggmap](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggmap) provide a simple and effective way to plot spatial data. 

In this meetup, Ilyas will provide some insight into spatial plotting by making use of some of the packages available in R with an application using real data.
