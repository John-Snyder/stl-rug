Data visualization is one of the most important (and often overlooked) part of the data science process. My talk will be on how to visualize data effectively in R using the fantastic [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2) package. I will focus both on introducing the ggplot syntax as well as on discussing good visualization practices. This will be done interactively by looking at a real dataset and trying to answer questions about the data. If you feel so inclined bring a laptop with R and RStudio installed so you can follow along!

# ggplot2_tutorial
Presentation for the St. Louis R meetup

You can click [here](http://rpubs.com/apapiu/ggplot2_tutorial) for an html version of the tutorial.

If you want to run the code on your own machine: click on `UseR_presentation.Rmd` above, then right-click on the raw button and select the "Save content as..." "UseR_presentation.Rmd". Then simply open UseR_presentation.Rmd in RStudio. If you're not too familiar with RMarkdown read more about it [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). 

I recommend updating RStudio (go to help - check for updates in RStudio) so you can run the chunks in the Rmd file and see the output inline.
